# HW 03
- Create class `Driver`.
```java
public class Driver {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String licenseNumber;
}
```
- Create `ManufacturerService` and its implementation. Annotations `@Service` and `@Inject` have already been given to you.
### ManufacturerService methods:
    - Manufacturer create(Manufacturer manufacturer);
    - Manufacturer get(Long id);
    - List<Manufacturer> getAll();
    - Manufacturer update(Manufacturer manufacturer);
    - boolean delete(Long id);
- Create Dao and Service layers for `Driver` and their implementations.
### DriverService methods:
    - Driver create(Driver driver);
    - Driver get(Long id);
    - List<Driver> getAll();
    - Driver update(Driver driver);
    - boolean delete(Long id);

 

- Do not forget about DB naming rules mentioned in previous homework.
- Test your code in `main`.
- Main should only contain invocation of `Service` methods, no Dao methods allowed in `main`.
- Do not forget about Dependency Injection. Use your annotations.
